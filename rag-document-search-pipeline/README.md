# RAG Document Search Pipeline

## Problem
Let users ask questions over a document collection and retrieve grounded answers with citations.

## Data
Public docs and filings

## Stack
Python, embeddings, vector store, LLM API, FastAPI

## Architecture
- Bronze / raw ingestion layer
- Silver / cleaned and validated data layer
- Gold / feature or serving layer
- Monitoring / validation and retraining feedback loop

## DE tasks
1. Ingest raw data with versioned file naming and timestamps.
2. Build idempotent and incremental transformations.
3. Add data quality checks and freshness alerts.
4. Create a reproducible run order using a Makefile or run script.
5. Store outputs in a warehouse, lake, or streaming sink with clear contracts.

## DS tasks
1. Run EDA and validate assumptions about seasonality, drift, and user behavior.
2. Benchmark a baseline model before trying a stronger approach.
3. Use proper time-based splits and avoid leakage.
4. Log experiments, tuning choices and key metrics.
5. Report limitations and next steps in a production-focused way.

## Deliverables
- Reproducible pipeline or app
- Tests for transformation and validation logic
- Dashboard, API, or report showing outputs
- Clear business summary with measurable impact

## Resume line
Built a RAG pipeline with incremental ingestion and improved retrieval quality through chunking and re-ranking experiments.
